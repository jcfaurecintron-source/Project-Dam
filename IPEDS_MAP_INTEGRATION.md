# IPEDS Institution Counts - Map Integration Complete âœ…

## What Was Done

Successfully integrated IPEDS institution counts into the map insight panels. When users click on an MSA county on the map, the panel now displays the number of higher education institutions in that MSA.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated InsightPanel Component (`components/InsightPanel.tsx`)

**Added institution count field to data interface:**
```typescript
interface InsightPanelData {
  // ... existing fields ...
  institutionCount?: number | null;  // NEW: IPEDS institution count
}
```

**Added new institution tile to the panel:**
- Positioned in Row 1 alongside Employment and Mean Annual tiles
- Displays with ðŸŽ“ emoji and "colleges" label
- Shows institution count with proper number formatting
- Only displays when data is available
- Styled with indigo gradient to distinguish from other metrics

### 2. Updated MapLive Component (`components/MapLive.tsx`)

**Added institution data loading:**
```typescript
// Load institution counts from IPEDS
const institutionsResponse = await fetch('/data/institutions_fl.json');
const institutionsData = await institutionsResponse.json();
const msaCounts: Record<string, number> = {};
// Store as MSA name â†’ count map for fast lookup
```

**Wired institution counts into panel data:**
```typescript
// Get institution count for this MSA
const institutionCount = institutionsDataRef.current[record.msa_name] ?? null;

const insightData: InsightPanelData = {
  // ... existing fields ...
  institutionCount: institutionCount,  // NEW
};
```

## User Experience

### Before
- Panel showed 6 tiles: Employment, Mean Annual, YoY Growth, Median Annual, 3-Year Trend, Wage Range

### After
- Panel now shows **7 tiles** when institution data is available
- New **ðŸŽ“ Institutions** tile appears in Row 1
- Shows real IPEDS data: "133 colleges" for Miami, "46 colleges" for Tampa, etc.
- Gracefully handles MSAs without institution data (tile doesn't appear)

## Sample Output

When clicking on **Miami-Fort Lauderdale MSA**:
```
ðŸŽ“ Institutions
133 colleges
```

When clicking on **Tampa-St. Petersburg MSA**:
```
ðŸŽ“ Institutions
46 colleges
```

When clicking on **Orlando MSA**:
```
ðŸŽ“ Institutions
42 colleges
```

## Data Flow

```
User clicks MSA
    â†“
MapLive fetches OEWS data (employment, wages)
    â†“
MapLive looks up institution count by MSA name
    â†“
Both datasets combined into InsightPanelData
    â†“
InsightPanel renders all tiles including institutions
    â†“
User sees comprehensive MSA analytics
```

## Technical Details

### Data Source
- **File**: `/public/data/institutions_fl.json`
- **Format**: `{ "msa_counts": { "MSA Name": count, ... } }`
- **Loading**: Fetched once at component mount
- **Lookup**: O(1) hash map lookup by MSA name

### Performance
- Institution data loaded asynchronously with OEWS data
- Cached in ref for entire component lifecycle
- No additional API calls per click
- Fast lookups using pre-indexed map

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if institutions_fl.json not found
- Console warning logged if data unavailable
- Panel renders normally without institution tile
- No blocking errors or crashes

## Testing Checklist

âœ… Institution count appears for MSAs with data  
âœ… Tile doesn't appear for MSAs without data  
âœ… Correct counts displayed (matches institutions_fl.json)  
âœ… Formatting is consistent with other tiles  
âœ… No TypeScript errors  
âœ… No console errors  
âœ… Panel layout doesn't break with new tile  

## Example MSA Counts (2020 IPEDS Data)

| MSA | Count | Display |
