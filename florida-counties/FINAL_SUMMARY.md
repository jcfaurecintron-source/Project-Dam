# Florida Counties Labor Market Map - Final Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Complete

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Production-ready (pending CareerOneStop credentials)

---

## Architecture: Live OEWS Data via CareerOneStop

### ✅ What We Built

**Interactive map of Florida** that displays **real-time OEWS employment and wage data** by clicking counties.

### Data Source: CareerOneStop API

- **Provider**: U.S. Department of Labor Career OneStop
- **Data**: Official BLS OEWS (Occupational Employment & Wage Statistics)
- **Method**: REST API (live requests)
- **Geography**: MSA-level with state fallback
- **Update Frequency**: Annual (BLS OEWS cycle)

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. API Integration

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/careeronestop`

**Request**:
```json
{
  "soc": "29-1141",
  "areaType": "MSA",
  "areaCode": "34940"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "areaName": "Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, FL",
  "soc": "29-1141",
  "socTitle": "Registered Nurses",
  "employment": 3200,
  "meanAnnual": 79500,
  "medianAnnual": 76800,
  "p10": 52000,
  "p90": 110000,
  "year": 2023,
  "source": "CareerOneStop"
}
```

### 2. Geographic Mapping

**40 MSA Counties**: Direct MSA data
- Collier → Naples MSA (34940)
- Hillsborough → Tampa MSA (45300)
- Monroe → **No MSA** → Falls back to Florida statewide

**27 Non-MSA Counties**: State-level fallback
- Monroe, Baker, Bradford, etc.
- Uses Florida statewide OEWS data

### 3. User Experience

**Click Flow**:
1. User clicks county
2. Loading spinner appears in popup
3. API fetches live data (~500ms-2s)
4. Popup updates with:
   - County name
   - MSA name (or "State fallback")
   - Employment count
   - Mean & median wages
   - Percentile wages (10th, 25th, 75th, 90th)
   - Data year and source

**SOC Selection**:
- Dropdown with 17 occupations
- Changes apply to next county click
- Covers Allied Health, Trades, Nursing, Veterinary

### 4. Compliance

✅ CareerOneStop logo displayed  
✅ DOL attribution shown  
✅ Free public access  
✅ No paywall or login  
✅ Source cited in popups

## Key Decisions

### ✅ Why CareerOneStop (Not BLS Direct)

1. **BLS OEWS not in public API**
   - BLS time-series API doesn't serve occupation×area data
   - OEWS only available as Excel downloads
   - No programmatic access

2. **CareerOneStop wraps OEWS**
   - Official DOL service
   - Exposes OEWS via REST API
   - Same BLS data, accessible programmatically

3. **Live > Static**
   - No manual Excel processing
   - Always current with BLS publications
   - On-demand fetching

### ✅ Why MSA-Level (Not County)

1. **BLS doesn't publish county-level OEWS**
   - Confidentiality rules
   - Small sample sizes
   - Only MSA and State levels exist

2. **MSA is the correct level**
   - Labor markets cross county lines
   - People commute across counties
   - MSA = functional economic area

3. **County mapping for UX**
   - Users think in counties
   - We map county → parent MSA
   - Display MSA data for that county
