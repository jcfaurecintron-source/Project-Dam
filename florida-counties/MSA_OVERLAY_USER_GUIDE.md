## Understanding the Metrics

### Population
- **Source**: U.S. Census Bureau (ACS 2022)
- **What it means**: Total people living in this MSA
- **Use case**: Understand market size

### Competitors
- **Source**: Department of Education College Scorecard
- **What it means**: Schools offering programs matching this occupation
- **Phase 1 Note**: Limited to 1 school for testing
- **Use case**: Assess competition level

### Density
- **Formula**: (Competitors / Population) √ó 100,000
- **What it means**: Number of competing schools per 100k people
- **Higher = More Competition**: More schools serving the same population
- **Lower = Opportunity**: Fewer schools, potential gap in market
- **Use case**: Identify underserved markets

## Example Scenario

**You want to start a Nursing program in Florida...**

1. Select **"29-1141 - Registered Nurses"** from dropdown
2. Click **Miami MSA** on the map
3. See:
   - Population: ~6.2 million people
   - Competitors: 1 school (Miami Dade College)
   - Density: 0.016 per 100k
4. Click the red marker to visit Miami Dade's website
5. Compare with **Tallahassee MSA**:
   - Population: ~385,000 people
   - Competitors: 1 school
   - Density: 0.260 per 100k (higher competition relative to population)

**Insight**: Miami has lower density = potentially more room for additional programs despite high competition in absolute numbers.

## Data Sources

All data is fetched live from official government APIs:

1. **Census Bureau API**
   - Population estimates (ACS 2022)
   - No registration required
   - Updated annually

2. **Department of Education College Scorecard**
   - Institution locations and programs
   - CIP-based program matching
   - Updated 2024 data

3. **BLS OEWS (existing)**
   - Employment and wage data
   - May 2024 latest

## Performance & Caching

- **First Click**: ~2-5 seconds (API calls to Census + College Scorecard)
- **Subsequent Clicks**: Instant (cached for 24 hours)
- **Cache Reset**: Automatic after 24 hours
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect API limits

## Troubleshooting

### No Population Data
- Some smaller MSAs may not have Census data available
- Panel will show "‚Äî" for population
- Density cannot be calculated without population

### No Competitors Found
- The selected occupation may not have matching CIP codes
- Or no Florida schools offer that program in this MSA
- Panel will show 0 competitors

### Markers Don't Appear
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify server is running (`npm run dev`)
- Try refreshing the page

### API Errors
- Census API might be temporarily unavailable
- College Scorecard API might be down
- Map continues working with existing wage/employment data
- Competitor tiles will show "‚Äî"

## Testing the Feature

Run the test script to verify all MSAs:

```bash
cd florida-counties
npx tsx scripts/test-msa-overlay.ts
```

This will test 6 major MSAs with 3 different occupations and show success/failure rates.

## Phase 1 Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Version (Phase 1 - Validation)**

- **Limited to 1 institution per MSA** for stability testing
- Once validated, Phase 2 will show ALL competitors
- No historical trends (snapshot only)
- No program size/completions data yet

## What's Coming in Phase 2?

üöÄ **Planned Enhancements:**

1. **Remove 1-school limit** - Show all competitors
2. **Marker clustering** - Handle dense MSAs gracefully
3. **Program intensity** - Add completions data
4. **CareerOneStop integration** - Include non-degree programs
5. **Advanced filtering** - By school type, size, etc.
6. **Historical trends** - Track competitor changes over time

## Tips for Best Results

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Test with major MSAs first (Miami, Tampa, Orlando)
- Try different occupations to see data variety
- Click markers to explore school details
- Use density metric to identify opportunities

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Expect instant results on first click (APIs take time)
- Rely on Phase 1 competitor counts for decisions (only shows 1)
- Compare density across vastly different MSA sizes without context

## Support & Feedback

- Check browser console for detailed logs
- Review `MSA_COMPETITOR_OVERLAY_SUMMARY.md` for technical details
- Report issues with specific MSA codes and SOC codes
