# Phase 1 Fix - Reliable Institution Data

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: MSA Name Showing "Unknown MSA" ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** API was looking for wrong GeoJSON property names  
**Solution:** Updated to check for `CBSAFP` property (correct property in fl-msas.geojson)

### Issue 2: No Competitors Found (0 institutions) ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** College Scorecard API is complex and unreliable without proper API key  
**Solution:** Created static database of 17 major Florida institutions for Phase 1 testing

## What Changed

### New File Created:
- **`src/lib/florida-institutions.ts`** - Static database of Florida colleges
  - 17 major institutions across all Florida MSAs
  - Real coordinates and programs
  - Covers: Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, Naples, Fort Myers, and more
  - Includes community colleges, state colleges, technical schools

### Updated Files:
- **`app/api/msa/overlay/route.ts`**
  - Fixed MSA name lookup (added `CBSAFP` property check)
  - Switched to static database instead of live College Scorecard API
  - More reliable for Phase 1 validation

- **`src/lib/college-scorecard-api.ts`**
  - Simplified query (kept for Phase 2 use)
