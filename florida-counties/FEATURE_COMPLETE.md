## What Was Built

### 🔧 Backend Infrastructure

1. **SOC→CIP Mapping System**
   - File: `src/lib/soc-cip-mapping.ts`
   - 9 occupations mapped to educational programs
   - Easily extensible for additional mappings

2. **Census API Integration**
   - File: `src/lib/census-api.ts`
   - Real-time population data from U.S. Census Bureau
   - ACS 2022 5-Year Estimates
   - Rate limiting and error handling

3. **College Scorecard API Integration**
   - File: `src/lib/college-scorecard-api.ts`
   - Department of Education institution database
   - CIP-based program filtering
   - Spatial point-in-polygon filtering for MSA boundaries

4. **API Endpoint with Caching**
   - File: `app/api/msa/overlay/route.ts`
   - Endpoint: `/api/msa/overlay?msa=CBSA&soc=SOC`
   - 24-hour in-memory cache
   - Parallel API calls for performance
   - Comprehensive error handling

### 🎨 Frontend Components

5. **Enhanced InsightPanel**
   - File: `components/InsightPanel.tsx`
   - Three new metric tiles:
     - 🏙️ **Population** (indigo theme)
     - 🏫 **Competitors** (rose theme)
     - 📊 **Density** (cyan theme)
   - Conditional rendering (only shows when data available)

6. **Interactive Map Markers**
   - File: `components/MapLive.tsx`
   - Red circular markers with school emoji (🏫)
   - Click-to-popup with school details
   - Auto-update on SOC change
   - Cleanup on panel close
   - Marker management with refs

### 📊 TypeScript Types

7. **Type Definitions**
   - File: `src/lib/types.ts`
   - `CompetitorInstitution` interface
   - `MsaOverlayData` interface
   - Extended `InsightPanelData` with overlay fields

### 🧪 Testing Tools

8. **Test Script**
   - File: `scripts/test-msa-overlay.ts`
   - Tests 6 major Florida MSAs
   - Tests 3 different occupations
   - Success rate reporting

## How to Test Right Now

### 1. Development Server is Running
Your Next.js server should already be running at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Manual Testing Steps

**Basic Flow:**
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Select "29-1141 - Registered Nurses" from SOC dropdown
3. Click **Miami MSA** on the map
4. Observe:
   - ✅ InsightPanel opens with 9 tiles total
   - ✅ Three new tiles show: Population, Competitors (1), Density
   - ✅ Red marker appears on map
   - ✅ Click marker → popup with school details

**SOC Change Test:**
1. With panel open, change SOC to "47-2111 - Electricians"
2. Observe:
   - ✅ Markers update automatically
   - ✅ Tiles refresh with new data
   - ✅ No visual glitches

**Cleanup Test:**
1. Close panel with X button or ESC
2. Observe:
   - ✅ All markers disappear
   - ✅ Map returns to clean state

### 3. Automated Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
cd florida-counties
npx tsx scripts/test-msa-overlay.ts
```

Expected output:
- Tests 18 MSA×SOC combinations
- Should see 80-100% success rate
- Some combinations may have no data (expected)

---

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ Success Cases

**Miami MSA (33100) with Registered Nurses:**
- Population: ~6,200,000
- Competitors: 1
- Density: ~0.016 per 100k
- Marker: Miami Dade College

**Tampa MSA (45300) with Electricians:**
- Population: ~3,100,000
- Competitors: 1
- Density: ~0.032 per 100k
- Marker: Relevant trade school

### ⚠️ Expected Limitations (Phase 1)

- **Only 1 competitor shown** per MSA (intentional for validation)
- Some MSAs may have **no Census data** (smaller areas)
- Some SOCs may have **no competitors** (program not offered)
- First load takes **2-5 seconds** (API calls)
- Subsequent loads are **instant** (cached)

## Browser Console Messages

When working correctly, you'll see:
```
✅ Loaded 2100+ OEWS 2024 records
✅ Loaded 2100+ OEWS series records
✅ Fetched competitor overlay: {msa: {...}, population: 6200000, ...}
✅ Added 1 competitor marker(s)
```

If you see errors, check:
- Network tab for API failures
- Console for detailed error messages
- Server logs for backend issues
