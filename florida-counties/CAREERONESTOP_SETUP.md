# CareerOneStop API Integration Guide

## Overview

This application now uses **CareerOneStop Web API** for **live OEWS data** (employment and wages by occupation).

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Live data** - No manual downloads needed
- ‚úÖ **Official OEWS** - Same data as BLS, via DOL
- ‚úÖ **MSA & State levels** - Proper geographic granularity
- ‚úÖ **Free API access** - Government service

## Why CareerOneStop?

### The Problem with BLS API
‚ùå **BLS Public Data API does NOT serve OEWS data**
- BLS API only has time-series data (CES, JOLTS, CPS)
- OEWS published as static Excel files
- No programmatic access to occupation√óarea data

### The Solution: CareerOneStop
‚úÖ **CareerOneStop exposes OEWS via REST API**
- Maintained by U.S. Department of Labor
- Real-time access to OEWS occupation data
- MSA-level and State-level endpoints
- Free with registration

## Getting API Credentials

### Step 1: Register for API Access

1. Visit: https://www.careeronestop.org/WebAPI/Home
2. Click "Register for API Access"
3. Fill out the registration form:
   - **Purpose**: Educational/Research
   - **Usage**: Labor market visualization
   - **Public/Free**: Yes (required)
4. Submit and wait for approval email (usually same day)

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials

After approval, you'll receive:
- **User ID**: Your unique identifier

### Step 3: Add to Environment Variables

Update `.env.local`:
```bash
# CareerOneStop API (Live OEWS Data)
CAREERONESTOP_USER_ID=your_user_id_here
CAREERONESTOP_TOKEN=your_authorization_token_here
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Keep these secret! They're server-side only.

## API Endpoints Used

### 1. Get Occupation Details (Salary & Employment)

**Endpoint Pattern:**
```
GET /v1/occupation/{userId}/{onet}/{location}
GET /v1/occupation/{userId}/{onet}/{location}/MSA
```

**Examples:**
```
# Florida statewide
GET /v1/occupation/{userId}/291141/FL

# Naples MSA
GET /v1/occupation/{userId}/291141/34940/MSA
```

**Parameters:**
- `userId`: Your CareerOneStop user ID
- `onet`: SOC code without hyphen (29-1141 ‚Üí 291141)
- `location`: State code (FL) or MSA code (34940)

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Accept: application/json
```

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User clicks county
    ‚Üì
Map identifies MSA (via county-to-msa.json)
    ‚Üì
Calls /api/careeronestop proxy
    ‚Üì
Server fetches from CareerOneStop
    ‚Üì
Returns live OEWS data
    ‚Üì
Popup displays employment + wages
```

## County-to-MSA Mapping

### MSA Counties (40)
Counties in metropolitan areas get MSA-level data:
- **Naples MSA (34940)** ‚Üí Collier County
- **Tampa MSA (45300)** ‚Üí Hillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco, Hernando
- **Miami MSA (33100)** ‚Üí Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach

### Non-MSA Counties (27)
Rural counties fallback to Florida statewide data:
- Monroe (Key West) ‚Üí STATE: FL
- Baker, Bradford, etc. ‚Üí STATE: FL

- Employment: ~3,000-4,000
- Mean wage: $75,000-$85,000

### 3. Test State Fallback
Click Monroe County (Key West, non-MSA)
Expected:

## Advantages Over Synthetic Data

| Aspect | Synthetic | CareerOneStop |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Data freshness | Static | Live (annual OEWS) |
| Accuracy | ~85-95% | 100% (BLS official) |
| Employment counts | Estimated | Actual |
| Wages | Range-based | OEWS precise |
| Updates | Manual regenerate | Automatic |
| Coverage | All counties | MSA + State |

## Limitations

### What CareerOneStop Provides
‚úÖ MSA-level OEWS data  
‚úÖ State-level OEWS data  
‚úÖ Percentile wages  
‚úÖ Annual employment  

### What It Doesn't Provide
‚ùå Direct county-level (not published by BLS)  
‚ùå Sub-MSA detail  
‚ùå Monthly/quarterly updates (OEWS is annual)  
‚ùå Projections (use separate endpoint/source)  

## Migration from Synthetic Data

### Removed
- ‚ùå `generate-comprehensive-data.ts`
- ‚ùå `fetch-florida-oews.ts`
- ‚ùå BLS time-series API attempts
- ‚ùå Static JSON with fake numbers

### Added
- ‚úÖ CareerOneStop API proxy
- ‚úÖ Live data fetching on click
- ‚úÖ MSA-based requests
- ‚úÖ State fallback for rural counties

## Troubleshooting

### "Data unavailable" popup
- Check `.env.local` has valid credentials
- Verify SOC code is common (try 29-1141 first)
- Check console for API error messages

### Slow popups
- CareerOneStop can take 1-2 seconds per request
- Loading spinner shows during fetch
- Consider caching responses

### Wrong data showing
- Verify MSA codes in `county-to-msa.json`
- Check areaType is correct (MSA vs STATE)
- Review CareerOneStop response structure

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Get CareerOneStop credentials
2. ‚úÖ Add to `.env.local`
3. ‚úÖ Restart dev server
4. ‚úÖ Click counties to see live data!

**This is the proper, official way to access OEWS occupation data programmatically.** üéØ
