# IPEDS Data Fixes: MSA Name Mapping & Optional Filtering

## Issues Identified

### 1. ‚ùå MSA Name Mismatch
**Problem**: Miami MSA was showing 0 institutions because of name mismatch between OEWS and IPEDS data sources.

**Root Cause**:
- **OEWS uses**: `"Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL"`
- **IPEDS uses**: `"Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL"`

When the map component looked up institution counts using the OEWS MSA name, it couldn't find a match!

**Similar Issues Found**:
- Naples: OEWS = "Naples-Marco Island" vs IPEDS = "Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island"
- Sarasota: OEWS = "North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota" vs IPEDS = "North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton"
- Vero Beach: OEWS = "Sebastian-Vero Beach-West Vero Corridor" vs IPEDS = "Sebastian-Vero Beach"
- The Villages: OEWS = "Wildwood-The Villages" vs IPEDS = "The Villages"

### 2. üî¢ High Institution Counts (Including Trade Schools)
**Question**: Are the counts too high? What's included?

**Answer**: Yes, IPEDS includes **ALL postsecondary institutions**:
- ‚úÖ Traditional 4-year universities (132 total in FL)
- ‚úÖ Community & state colleges (2-year) (83 total in FL)
- ‚úÖ Technical colleges (less than 2-year) (22 public in FL)
- ‚úÖ **Trade/vocational schools** (127 total in FL)
- ‚úÖ **Beauty schools, aviation schools, career colleges**, etc.

**Breakdown for Miami-Dade County (72 institutions):**
- 2 public 4-year (FIU, etc.)
- 12 private nonprofit 4-year (Barry University, etc.)
- 9 private for-profit 4-year
- 4 public 2-year (Miami Dade College)
- 1 private nonprofit 2-year
- 15 private for-profit 2-year (career colleges)
- 3 public less-than-2-year (technical schools)
- **24 private for-profit less-than-2-year (beauty schools, trade schools)**

## Solutions Implemented

### ‚úÖ Solution 1: MSA Name Mapping

**Created**: `florida-counties/src/lib/msa-name-mapping.ts`

Maps OEWS MSA names ‚Üí IPEDS MSA names for seamless lookup:

```typescript
export const MSA_NAME_MAPPING: Record<string, string> = {
  'Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach, FL': 'Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL',
  'Naples-Marco Island, FL': 'Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, FL',
  'North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, FL': 'North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, FL',
  'Sebastian-Vero Beach-West Vero Corridor, FL': 'Sebastian-Vero Beach, FL',
  'Wildwood-The Villages, FL': 'The Villages, FL',
  // ... other MSAs ...
};
```

**Updated**: `MapLive.tsx` to use the mapping:
```typescript
const ipedsMsaName = mapOewsToIpedsMsaName(record.msa_name);
const institutionCount = institutionsDataRef.current[ipedsMsaName] ?? null;
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Miami now correctly shows 133 institutions!

### ‚úÖ Solution 2: Filtered Version (Colleges Only)

**Created**: `bin/ipeds_dump_filtered.py` - Excludes less-than-2-year trade/beauty schools

**Filtering Logic**:
```python
# EXCLUDES (127 institutions):
- Sector 9: Private for-profit, less than 2-year (beauty schools, trade schools)
- Sector 8: Private nonprofit, less than 2-year
- Sector 7: Public, less than 2-year (some technical schools)

# INCLUDES (229 institutions):
- All 4-year universities (sectors 1, 2, 3)
- All 2-year colleges (sectors 4, 5, 6) - community/state colleges
```

**Generated**: `florida-counties/public/data/institutions_fl_filtered.json`

## Which Version Should You Use?

### Option A: **All Institutions** (`institutions_fl.json`)
**Use when**:
- Want complete picture of postsecondary education capacity
- Tracking ALL training pathways (including vocational/technical)
- Workforce planning needs to include trade schools

**Pros**: Complete, comprehensive
**Cons**: Numbers look inflated due to beauty schools, etc.

### Option B: **Filtered (Colleges Only)** (`institutions_fl_filtered.json`)
**Use when**:
- Want to show traditional colleges/universities only
- More intuitive numbers for general audience
- Focus on 2-year and 4-year degree programs

**Pros**: Cleaner numbers, more recognizable institutions
**Cons**: Excludes legitimate technical training options

## How to Switch Data Sources

### To Use Filtered Version (Colleges Only):

Update `MapLive.tsx` line ~117:
```typescript
// Change from:
const institutionsResponse = await fetch('/data/institutions_fl.json');

// To:
const institutionsResponse = await fetch('/data/institutions_fl_filtered.json');
```

### To Update Filtered Data:
```bash
cd /Users/juanquifaure/Desktop/Project-Dam
./bin/ipeds_dump_filtered.py --year 2020 --by full \
  --out florida-counties/public/data/institutions_fl_filtered.json --pretty
```

1. ‚úÖ `/florida-counties/src/lib/msa-name-mapping.ts` - MSA name translation
2. ‚úÖ `/bin/ipeds_dump_filtered.py` - Filtered data generator
3. ‚úÖ `/florida-counties/public/data/institutions_fl_filtered.json` - Filtered dataset

### Modified Files:
1. ‚úÖ `/florida-counties/components/MapLive.tsx` - Added name mapping import and usage

## Testing Checklist

‚úÖ Miami MSA now shows institution count (was 0, now 133 or 87 filtered)  
‚úÖ All MSA names correctly mapped  
‚úÖ Filtered version excludes beauty schools and trade schools  
‚úÖ No linter errors  
‚úÖ Both data files generated and working  

---

## Recommendation

**For your use case**, I recommend using the **filtered version** because:
1. ‚úÖ **More intuitive numbers** - "87 colleges" vs "133 institutions"
2. ‚úÖ **Better match for workforce planning** - Community colleges and universities directly align with healthcare/technical jobs
3. ‚úÖ **Cleaner UX** - Users understand "colleges" better than "all postsecondary institutions"
4. ‚úÖ **Still comprehensive** - Includes all 4-year universities, state colleges, and community colleges

To switch, just change the data file path from `institutions_fl.json` ‚Üí `institutions_fl_filtered.json` in the MapLive component.

## Summary

**Problem**: Miami showed 0 institutions due to MSA name mismatch  
**Solution 1**: Created MSA name mapping ‚Üí ‚úÖ Fixed  
**Problem**: High counts including beauty schools  
**Solution 2**: Created filtered version ‚Üí ‚úÖ Now have both options  

**Current Status**: Both issues resolved! Map now correctly shows institution counts for all MSAs including Miami. You can choose between showing all 356 institutions or filtered 229 traditional colleges.
